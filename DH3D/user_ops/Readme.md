## Customized TF Operators
This folder mainly contains customized Tensorflow operations from [Flex-Convolution](https://github.com/cgtuebingen/Flex-Convolution) (Groh et al, ACCV2018).

DH3D uses the flex_conv, flex_pool and knn_bruteforece layers in Flex-Convolution. We also provide 1x1 convolution implementation(conv_relative) on 3D points.

Before using, the TF ops need to be compiled, see the detailed build instructions [here](https://github.com/cgtuebingen/Flex-Convolution).
