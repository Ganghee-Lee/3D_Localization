## Customized TF Operators
This folder contains customized Tensorflow operations from [PointNet++](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2) (Qi et al, NIPS2017).

DH3D uses the sampling and interpolation layers in PointNet++.

Before using, the TF ops need to be compiled, see the the detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2#compile-customized-tf-operators).
